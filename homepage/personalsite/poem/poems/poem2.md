# Especially Then

some nights i sit in the dark
and feel nothing,
and that nothing
starts to feel like everything.
like an ocean i can’t swim in
but never stops rising.

i don’t know how to explain it—
this quiet grief
for a life i’m still inside.
like mourning myself
while wearing my own skin.

people keep saying
“you have so much potential.”
they say it like it’s supposed to save me.
but i swear
the weight of that sentence
has almost buried me.

i don’t want to be special.
i want to be okay.
i want mornings that don’t feel like
apologies.
i want silence that doesn’t echo
with everything i never said
because i was scared of being too much,
or worse—
not enough.

there are days
where i forget how to be a person.
how to answer
“how are you?”
without lying.
without pausing.
without wanting to disappear
into a place where people don’t need me
to be anything
other than breathing.

i used to dream about love.
now i just dream about rest.
about peace that doesn’t come with guilt.
about someone looking at me
and not flinching
when they see the mess.

tell me—
what do you do with all the pain
you can’t explain?
the kind that doesn’t cry,
just quietly folds itself
into your spine
and waits?

i’m not writing this for pity.
i just needed
someone to know
i’m trying.
even when it looks like i’ve given up.

especially then.
