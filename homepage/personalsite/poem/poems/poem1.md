#My Life, Mine, All Mine


My life—mine,
all mine—
but what does that mean
when I can't always feel it pulsing in my chest?
Some days it's just dust
clinging to the edges of an old windowpane,
waiting for light that never quite arrives.

I did not ask for this body.
I did not sign the lease for this name.
Yet here I am,
occupying a space I don’t always believe I deserve.
My hands move, yes—
but who’s writing the script?

I walk through corridors of maybe and might-have-been,
my shadow stretching longer than my story.
People speak of purpose
like it’s a fire you carry in your gut.
But mine flickers,
small, blue,
almost gone when the wind sighs too hard.

I am told: choose joy.
But joy isn’t a door—
it’s a lock
with no key that fits these trembling fingers.

And still,
this life is mine.
All mine.
To waste, to wonder,
to bury in silence or scream into the void.
No one can live it for me.
No one can suffer it quite the way I do.
That is the strangest freedom.

I hold it close like a cold stone—
not warm, but real.
I whisper to it:
“You are mine.”
And even in sorrow,
there’s something defiant in that.

Even in the ache,
I remain.
