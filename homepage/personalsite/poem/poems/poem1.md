#I stayed


I didn’t stay
for them.
Or for duty.
Not even for love.
I stayed
because I forgot
how not to.

Do you know what it’s like
to love someone so much
That you vanish
from your own reflection?
I don’t remember my face.
Only how your eyes looked
And the helm.

I said I’d come back.
I lied.
Beautifully.
The kind of lie
that leaves a dress hanging
in a closet.
Untouched.

Tonight,
the sea speaks in lightning.
She drags her fingers
along the hull
like she’s reading my eulogy
in Braille.

Our song playing,
For the last time.
The one you said
sounded like
someone remembering
they were once loved.

This ship
is no longer a ship.
It is a mouth
swallowing prayers.
A cathedral
collapsing inward.

Page 2/2:

They’ll say I died
with honor.
No.
I died with your name
in my lungs.
So I could breathe you
once more
before the ocean
stitched me shut.

I remember the yellow field.
You wore sunlight
like a veil.
You said,
Why does Jack always die?
I said,
Because Rose floated.

Now I can say
He didn’t die
for love.
He died because
time doesn’t wait.

I wonder
if you’ll walk the aisle
with no one waiting.
Or sit in a pew
like a secret
no one wants to confess.
I hope
they don’t play
this song.
It’s cursed now.

I’m not afraid
to die.
I’ve been disappearing
for years.
But what I fear now
The promises.

The ring I bought,
I’ll never get to
give to you.
Just know:
in this storm,
your name is the only thing
that doesn’t wash away.
