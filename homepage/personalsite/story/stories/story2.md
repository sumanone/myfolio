#shadows in the rice field

The sun hung low over the horizon, spilling golden light across the paddies. Water shimmered between rows of young rice plants, and the air was thick with the scent of earth and growing things. But beneath that peaceful stillness, the villagers said the shadows moved differently in that field—the old one near the edge of the forest.

Mai had never believed the stories. Ghosts of the war, lost children, wandering spirits—it was all nonsense, meant to scare kids away from playing too close to the dikes. But that evening, as she walked home after helping her grandmother plant seedlings, something caught her eye. A flicker. A movement. A shape too large to be wind, too quiet to be human.

She froze, ankle-deep in water.

Across the field, the sun slipped behind the hills. Darkness crept in. The silhouette of a man stood where no one should be, tall and still among the rice stalks. He didn’t move. He didn’t wave. He simply stood, head tilted slightly, as if listening.

Mai’s breath caught.

Then, from the trees, a breeze stirred the bamboo and brought with it a low whisper.

“Mai...”

She turned and ran, sandals slapping mud, heart hammering like a drum. Behind her, the water rippled. Shadows lengthened.

She didn't look back.

That night, her grandmother said nothing, only placed a bowl of rice on the doorstep, facing the field.

“They visit when the sun dies,” the old woman murmured. “Some never left.”

Mai didn’t sleep. And the next day, when the wind was still and the paddies sparkled in the morning sun, she saw no sign of footprints. No broken stalks. Nothing disturbed.

Only shadows in the rice field.

But now, she watched them more closely.
